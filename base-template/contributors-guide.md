# Contributors' Guide

## Welcome to The Good Docs Project

The Good Docs Project provides a set of templates and other resources to help you create great documentation.
Anyone can come and make use of those resources, download the templates, and create their own documentation at any time.
If you have a great idea for improving any of the resources, we would love for you to share them!
This guide is to help you get started contributing to the Good Docs Project, whether you intend to contribute a whole new template to the collection, or just fix a typo.


## Getting Familiar with the Project Repositories

All of the source code for the Good Docs Project live in github, including the code for the website, examplar project, community governance, and the templates themselves.
Browse the code by navigating to https://github.com/thegooddocsproject/ in your browser.

There are several repositories within the Good Docs Project, and they all serve an individual purpose.
To contribute to the templates, there are two main repositories that you will need to work with, the `templates` repo, and the `incubator` repo.


### The `templates` repository

This is the main repository in the project, because it contains the templates, and their companion guidance documents.
If you want to make a small change to an existing template, such as updating some wording, or fixing a typo, you can propose a change directly within this repository.
Instructions on how to do that are later on in this guide.


### The `incubator` repository

The `incubator` repository is where we work on bigger projects, including new templates, before they are ready to be submitted to the `templates` repository.
If you want to contribute a new template, or a larger piece of work for any other repository, this is the place to start.
When you propose a change to the `incubator` repo, you can work on it in collaboration with the rest of the community, and it will be moved into the appropriate location when it is complete.


## Setting up your work environment

To work on content within the Good Docs Project, regardless of which repo you are proposing changes to, or whether the change is big or small, you will need to set up your work environment.
The main thing you will need is a text editor.


### Selecting a text editor

There are many text editors available, and people who work in text editors a lot will always have their favorites.
Because of this, it can be a little daunting trying to choose which one you like.

Some popular free text editors are [Atom](https://atom.io/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
They are both graphical editors, and include some convenient features like a file browser and a command prompt, so you can manage your entire workflow within the editor.

However, you don't need anything that fancy if you just want to do a couple of small things.
Your operating system will provide a simple text editor by default, and these are a great place to start:

| Operating System | Editor   |
| ---------------- | -------- |
| Windows          | Notepad  |
| MacOS            | TextEdit |
| Linux - Gnome    | gedit    |
| Linux - KDE      | KWrite   |

Once you've gotten started with a basic editor, you'll have a better idea of what features you want in a more advanced editor.


### Working with git

Version control with git can be confusing at first.
Generally speaking, though, you only need a few commands to get started, and once you've done it a few times, it will start to become second nature.
The important thing to remember is that if you get really confused and you're not sure what to do, you can always delete what you have on your local machine and start again, without losing too much work.


## Choosing something to work on

Compellingly iterate premium testing procedures through effective web services. Collaboratively recaptiualize client-based leadership skills rather than adaptive initiatives. Distinctively synthesize customer directed markets after worldwide portals. Appropriately exploit revolutionary e-services without excellent content. Assertively unleash clicks-and-mortar leadership skills with 2.0 action items.

### Issues

Assertively enhance functional solutions for synergistic opportunities. Proactively expedite cross-media synergy whereas cutting-edge services. Appropriately embrace principle-centered leadership via leveraged infomediaries. Competently negotiate top-line products through 24/365 experiences. Professionally matrix goal-oriented processes and bleeding-edge experiences.

### Pull Requests

Phosfluorescently actualize economically sound alignments rather than quality synergy. Seamlessly negotiate value-added intellectual capital before equity invested applications. Intrinsicly re-engineer real-time total linkage and bleeding-edge total linkage. Monotonectally procrastinate multimedia based internal or "organic" sources vis-a-vis impactful outsourcing. Appropriately visualize cross-media quality vectors and backward-compatible vortals.

### Moving out of the incubator

Credibly supply holistic materials without resource maximizing convergence. Interactively revolutionize e-business content after interdependent expertise. Uniquely synergize prospective niche markets before cost effective meta-services. Phosfluorescently initiate distributed core competencies rather than virtual architectures. Compellingly harness client-centered users whereas client-centered process improvements.

## Expectations and Responsibilities

Interactively provide access to economically sound core competencies whereas team driven convergence. Collaboratively plagiarize value-added outsourcing with high-payoff infomediaries. Phosfluorescently cultivate efficient e-tailers without proactive mindshare. Interactively provide access to excellent e-markets with seamless collaboration and idea-sharing. Phosfluorescently seize go forward architectures rather than standards compliant alignments.
