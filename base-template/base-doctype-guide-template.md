## Prerequisites

To make the best use of this guide, it helps if you have a working knowledge of:

* The project's documentation style guide.
* Technical writing basics.

## Primary goal

{Template author tip: Concisely state the primary purpose of this doctype, ideally in one or two short sentences.}

## Checklist

{Template author tip:

* Add checklist items which are specific to this `doctype`.

}

Before writing your {doctype} document, you should plan to address all items on the following checklist. Before finalizing, you should check they are complete.

* [ ] The document has been reviewed:
    * [ ] For clear writing and alignment with the writing style guide, ideally by a technical writer or editor.
    * [ ] For alignment with the {doctype} template, ideally by a technical writer, information architect, or content strategist.
    * [ ] For technical accuracy, ideally by a technical subject matter expert.
* [ ] {Further checklist items ... .}

## User stories

{Template author tip:

* You should document the key user stories that this template is likely to be used for.

}

When writing, it is important to understand who you are writing for, and ensure that you provide just the right amount of information to address their needs. The following user stories should help you achieve that.

A {doctype} document aims to address the following user stories:

* As a {user persona}, I want to {achieve a specific goal}, so that I can {achieve a larger business objective}.
* ...

_{TBD: We should link to a page we are yet to write helping people pick personas.}_

## Nature of content

{Template author tip: 

* Discuss the nature of the content for this doctype.
* Discuss what format will best express the nature of the content. For example, text only, or multi-media options such as diagrams, screenshots or video.
* Discuss how the format you choose will impact maintenance. This can include human work-hours, as well as ongoing processes and infrastructure requirements.
* Reference your style guide, which should have recommended guidelines for using multimedia, such as image size and video length.
* For content involving numbered items or steps, consider advising the author to "chunk" steps into sub-sections of approximately 5-10 steps. This makes the information easier to read and remember, and for procedures gives the end user a sense of accomplishment after each chunk is completed that encourages them to continue. This approach is used by major companies such as [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/procedures-instructions/writing-step-by-step-instructions#complex-procedures). Related research on chunking and usability is available from the [Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/short-term-memory-and-web-usability/).

### Priorities for each quality criteria

* Each `doctype` addresses different use cases. It targets different user personas, with different needs.
* As such, there are different weightings applied to quality characteristics for each `doctype`. Reference documentation needs to comprehensively address all the features in the latest version, but can tolerate lower quality writing. Tutorials likely need only cover a sample of use cases, for an older version of the software, but there is a greater need for writing quality.
* The following table is used to help prioritize your time when writing for this {doctype} doctype.

{Template author tip: Apply priorities to the table below.}

This table lists the relative importance of the following quality criteria for {doctype} documents.

|Quality criteria                                        |Priority to address                                                                |

## Implementation strategy

{Template author tip:

* This section is optional.
* In some cases there may be tips you can provide on how to create a specific `doctype`.

}

## Business case

{Template author tip:

* In this section, discuss strategies to calculate the cost of implementing this `doctype`. This may just be to reference the development strategy and maintenance strategy above.
* Then suggest business goals and reasons why this doctype would help address these goals. Business goals might be:
    * Increased developer efficiency.
    * Faster onboarding for users and/or developers.
    * Reduced support costs.
* Consider the case where the docs are only partially maintained. Would it be better to have no documentation than incorrect or partially maintained documentation?

}

### When to include {doctype} docs?

{Template author tip:

* Add a summarized list of reasons for writing the `doctype`, based on the business case above. 

}

You should write {doctype} docs when:

* {Reason 1.}
* {Reason 2.}

### When wouldn’t you include {doctype} docs?

{Template author tip:

* Add a summarized list of reasons for not including the `doctype`, based on the business case above. 

}

Don't write {doctype} docs if:

* {Reason 1.}
* {Reason 2.}

## Customization

{Template author tip:

* There are often multiple approaches to consider when implementing a `doctype`.
* In this section you should discuss different approaches that can be applied to this `doctype`, including logic and recommendations to help a docset owner select the best strategy for them.
* Often there would be a light and more comprehensive version of this template. Immature projects may only have the capacity to maintain the light version. You should discuss how a project might mature their docs from light to comprehensive versions.

_{TBD: Add further guidance and sample text here.}_

_{TBD: We are encouraging docset owners to branch a template and then customize. This branched version now won't track latest updates to The Good Docs Project templates. A more sustainable approach would be to have an accompanying configuration file which supports section inclusion logic and variables. A future toolchain would need to be set up before we could introduce accompanying config files.}_

* There are multiple approaches which can be taken to customize this template. These may depend upon:
    * The maturity of your project.
    * The size, interest, and skillsets of your contributor community.
    * The documentation goals you have for the project.
* This section discusses approaches you may take to customize this template to your project.

{Template author tip:

* {Add customization advice here. …}

}

## Maintenance strategy

See also the maintenance strategy section of the `doctype_guide`.

{Template author tip:

* In this section, you should recommend strategies for maintaining `doctype` documentation. This could include:
* Automated documentation generation from code.
* Automated reports which highlight:
    * When documentation is out of date with software.
    * When documentation hasn’t been reviewed for a while.
* Integrating documentation checklists into software deployment, build, and test processes.
* This section can remain empty if there are no extra recommendations to add beyond general guidance in the `doctype_guide`.

}

## Backing research and further reading

{Template author tip:

It isn’t sufficient to simply define best practices for a `doctype`. You need to provide compelling evidence as to why this is the best approach. If there isn't any research, then say so, provide your own recommendations, and explain why you think they are the best approach.

"Do the hard work to make it simple." [UK Open Government Design Principle](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles#do-the-hard-work-to-make-it-simple)

This section should summarize competing approaches and explain why you took the chosen approach.
* It might also suggest situations where a docset owner would select a different approach.
* Authoritative sources should be provided to justify recommendations.
* If this section becomes more than a page long, consider extracting out into a separate research paper and then reference the paper.
