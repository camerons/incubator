# Base template

## Overview

The base captures the structure and common elements that all types of documentation templates associated with The Good Docs Project (GDP) should follow. It includes guidance for downstream template authors to follow when creating a new template.

In our practice, the most commonly used documentation types are of concept, task, and reference. Any document that you create is likely to either be one of these types or a combination of a few of them. With the help of the base template, you can create a uniform, regulated template for any of these documentation types.


## Before you start
To be able to make the best of this base template,  you should have sufficient knowledge of:

1. Technical documentation types - to be able to identify the type of documentation you need to create a template for, or modify the existing one into.</li>
2. Writing technical documentation - to accurately and clearly express instructions to the reader.</li>


## Step-by-step guide
This section guides you through on how to create any template using the base template, for a certain type of documentation, in distinguishable steps. 

1. Identify the content that you need to have a template for. 

This would be content that is:
- Repetitive/similar in terms of:
   - Structure
   - Formatting, styles
   - Procedures 
   - Text such as descriptions, disclaimers, snippets etc.
  
that can be grouped together, written/presented in the same manner, and reused.<br>
<br>
- Does not have existing templates to accommodate above.
- Existing templates require modification to accommodate the above.

2. Identify a prototype, i.e., a  suitable sample document that you are going to base your template on. This document will have the most variety of the content that you will be covering, in your template.</li><br>

3. Identify the type of documentation you need to write the template for. This would broadly be one, or a combination of the following types of documentation:

- How-to guide
- Tutorial
- Reference
- Explanation

4. Identify the repetitive content in your documents. This could be for instance,

- Introduction - a generic intro that gets repeated in all docs. Could be that of the organization, department, documentation etc.
- Disclaimers, policies and other legal snippets that are applicable throughout.
- Structure and formatting such as headers, footers, font sizes, font types etc.
- Processes and procedures. 

5. Identify your target audience, so as to be able to give clear instructions on creating a new template,  from the perspective of your reader.

6. Create the template that you are going to need, giving out step-by-step instructions, in clear, simple language. 

Although the specific template you are creating may vary, ensure that you have covered the basics of a good template. 

Some of the essential elements of your template would be:

- Title - include a title. The title should be reflective of what your template is for. 
- Overview - a brief description of what your template can be used for.
- Prerequisites / before you start.
- Procedures.
- Images / screenshots.
- Code snippets - include a sample snippet with expected formatting and styles.
- Optionally, repetitive content like, organization introduction, disclaimer, glossary etc.
- Page structure - header, title, page numbers, table of content etc.
- Styles</li>
- Directory structure</li>
- Naming conventions for directories, files, documents etc.

7. Use consistent language and tone throughout your docs.
