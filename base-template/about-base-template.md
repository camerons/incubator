# About Base Template

## Introduction

It's important to document repetitive or iterative processes that you encounter in your routine work. The best documentation uses a formal structure with specified standards, and adheres to predefined style guides. Doing this can sometimes be tedious, futile, and time consuming, so documentation can be random, ad hoc, and of inferior quality and a poor standard. If the documentation is poor quality to begin with, and is frequently edited by random different users, the quality and integrity can become even worse.

Documentation must maintain consistency and integrity at all times. This is made easier by using a template for each documentation type. A good template helps you simplify the process of creating any required document. It can save you time and effort, while ensuring consistency, clarity, and uniformity across your documentation suite.

The base template goes one step further, in that it helps you create any template for a given document type. It gives you direction in building the required template for a specific use case.

Use the base template to create a uniform, regulated template for producing similarly structured documents for a certain process. It's also useful if you are making process changes that call for identical repetitive changes to documents that are similar in structure.

The base template guides you through the steps to create a functional template that can be reused, adhered to, and followed consistently throughout.

However, note that the base template cannot be used to arrive at the document type you need, and is not a substitute for any other template in the collection at the main repository. 

## Prerequisites

To make the best use of this base template, you need a working knowledge of:

- GitHub to download, edit, and use the base template.
- Markdown to create and edit the base template to suit your requirements.
- Different documentation types to identify if you need to create a new template or edit an existing one.
- Technical writing to produce a well-written document that includes the relevant reference aspects.

## Who will need the base template

The base template is for:

- Internal users - those who are already working in the Good Docs Project (GDP)
- External users - the community outside of the GDP

Who want to:

- Create new templates that do not yet exist within GDP
- Edit existing templates that require changes

## How do you know you need the base template

The base template is useful when:

- You have identified that the process or document type you are trying to create does not have an existing template in GDP
- You need to make significant changes to an existing GDP template
- You need to produce multiple, uniformly structured documents that are:
  - Reusable, subject to iterative changes
  - Sustainable, easily accessible, and maintainable
  - Made available to the community freely

## What will the base template cover

The base template includes:

- An overview of the template you are creating
- Prerequisites, the minimum requirements for accessing or  making use of the template
- Procedures, step-by-step instructions to create your template
- Examples, good examples of existing templates
