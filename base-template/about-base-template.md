# About Base Template

## Introduction

This document is used to create a uniform, regulated template for producing multiple similarly structured documents, that is, as a base template to create any other template. The base template guides you through the steps to create a functional template that can be reused, adhered to, and followed consistently throughout.

Using a well-defined, good template helps to maintain consistency and integrity across all documentation while simplifying the process of creating any required document. It can save you time and effort, while ensuring consistency, clarity, and uniformity across your documentation suite.

The base template goes one step further, in that it helps you create any template for a given document type. It gives you direction in building the required template for a specific use case.


## Prerequisites

To make the best use of this base template, you need a working knowledge of:

- GitHub to download, edit, and use the base template.
- Markdown to create and edit the base template to suit your requirements.
- Different documentation types to identify if you need to create a new template or edit an existing one.
- Technical writing to produce a well-written document that includes the relevant reference aspects.

## Who will need the base template

The base template is for:

- Internal users - The base template is for doc type template authors who wish to align and/or contribute to The Good Docs Project (GDP).
- External users - the community outside of the GDP.

Who want to:

- Create new templates that do not yet exist within the GDP.
- Edit existing templates that require changes.

## How do you know you need the base template

The base template is useful when:

- You have identified that the process or document type you are trying to create does not have an existing template in the GDP.
- You need to make significant changes to an existing GDP template.
- You need to produce multiple, uniformly structured documents that are:
  - Reusable, subject to iterative changes.
  - Sustainable, easily accessible, and maintainable.
  - Made available to the community freely.

## What will the base template cover

The base template includes:

- An overview of the template you are creating.
- Prerequisites, the minimum requirements for accessing or  making use of the template.
- Procedures, step-by-step instructions to create your template.

## Examples

Given below are two sample use cases that will help you identify whether you need to create a new template/modify an existing one, and how the base template can help you achieve that.

**Use Case 1**

Product JKL consists of dynamic and static features. Different developers work on developing the features independently and they are to  document the features they worked on, individually. They require a single template to ensure that all documentation for static as well as for dynamic, reflects the same consistency, style of writing, adheres to company guidelines and follows the same style guide and glossary. 

Sandra, the Technical Writer for JKL goes about creating a template for this requirement. She identifies that such a Feature document is a combination of technical reference related to the developed feature, and a how-to guide instructing the user on how to activate the specific feature. The existing templates are not likely to cover this scope fully, and therefore she creates a new How to Add a New Feature template for this purpose. 


The identifiable points in this process relating to the use of the base template are:

- Multiple documents with similar content needs to be produced
- The documents consist of elaborate technical references that require different displaying strategies such as tables, formulas, embedded code snippets etc.
- A considerable amount of repetitive content exists within the documents such as the product intro, disclaimer, legal requirements etc.
- The language used must remain consistent throughout and the in-house style guide has to be adhered to. 
(For example, always bolden the UI element that follows the verb “click”, use uppercase for tab names etc.)


Incorporating the above, Sandra creates a _How to Add a New Feature_ template with two variants, one for static features, and the other for dynamic features accommodating their specific technical reference sections, using the base template. 

**Use Case 2**

Company PQR provides intermediate service solutions to end customers who use multiple products that are run and used concurrently. PQR specializes in providing 24/7 critical support assisting the technical personnel run a smooth operation that faces a dynamic front end. While the staff of PQR are highly competent in their support service, they do not necessarily have in-depth knowledge in all of the components used by the different products.

The objective is to provide them with a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) that will cover all the required technical information and references that a PQR support personnel will need in time of critical system failure. 


The identifiable variables in this requirement are:
- Multiple documents for different levels of support (critical, medium, low) with just the right level of detail for each.
- Multiple documents each highlighting a different product, but with a similar level of information on the integrated solution.
- Different levels of engagement and competencies by the readers. For example, the SOP will be accessed by a developer to integrate a component different to his, or by a systems administrator trying to ensure all servers are running optimally, or by the end user trying to configure the product at his end.

Such a document as the above is a combination of all types of documentation, with just the right blend of how-to, technical reference, explanation and tutorial. The base template can be used to create an optimal template for this requirement, which then can be altered as per the level of engagement and competency of the reader.
