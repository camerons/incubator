# About Base Template

## Introduction
In our routine work, we often come across repetitive or iterative processes that need to be documented to a formal structure with specified standards, and adhering to predefined style guides. Documenting such routine exercises distinctly is often tedious, futile and time consuming leading to random, ad hoc documentation of inferior quality and poor standards. Additionally, with the probability of such documentation being produced, used and frequently edited by random different users, the quality and integrity is at further risk. 

It is, however, imperative that we maintain consistency and integrity in our documentation throughout at all times. This is when a “template” becomes useful  for a designated type of a document. A good template will help you simplify the process of creating any required document, save your time and effort, while ensuring consistency, clarity and uniformity across your documentation. 

The base template goes one step further in this methodology in that it helps you create any template for a given document type. It gives you direction in building the required template for a specific use case. 

You are likely to need the base template if you are looking at creating a uniform, regulated template for producing similarly structured documents for a certain process.  Or, if you are undergoing certain process changes that call for identical repetitive changes to a number of documents similar in structure. 

The base template will guide you through on how-to create the template you require, in simple steps with the eventual deliverable being a functional template that can be reused, adhered to, and followed consistently throughout. 

However, note that the base template cannot be used to arrive at the type of document you need, nor be used as a substitute for any other template. 


## Prerequisites
In order for you to make the best use of this base template, you would require minimum working knowledge of:

- Accessing Github repositories to be able to download, edit/change  and use the base template. 
- Markdown language to be able to create/edit the base template to suit your requirement.
- Different types of documentation so as to be able to identify if you are on this use case, i.e., whether you need to create a new template or edit an existing one.
- Technical writing so as to be able to produce a standard how-to guide incorporating the relevant reference aspects. 

## Who will need the base template?
The base template is aimed at:
<ol>
<li>Internal users - those who are already working in the Good Docs Project (GDP)</li>
<li>External users - the community outside of the GDP</li>
</ol>

Looking at:
<ol type="a">
<li>Creating new templates for documentation without templates</li>
<li>Editing existing templates that require changes</li>
</ol>

## How do you know you need the base template?

The following criteria will help you determine if the base template will be useful for your particular use case:
<ol>
<li>You should have identified that the process and/or the document type you are trying to create does not already have an existing template.</li>
<li>You need to do significant changes to the existing template.</li>
<li>You need to produce multiple, uniformly structured documents that are likely to be:
 <ol type="a"> 
<li>Reusable, subject to iterative changes</li>
<li>Sustainable, easily accessible and maintainable</li>
<li>Made available to the community freely (optional)</li>
</ol>  
</ol>

## What will the base template cover?

The base template will cover the following information:
<ol>
<li>An overview of what the base template is about.</li>
<li>Prerequisites / before you start section explaining minimum requirements for accessing / making use of the base template.</li>
<li>Reference section that will briefly guide the user to other relevant information. </li>
<li>Procedures / step-by-step guide on how to create any template using the base template.</li>
<li>Examples - a few good examples of existing good templates.</li>
</ol>
