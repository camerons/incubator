# What's in the base-template directory

This base-template directory contains templates and guides to be followed by a `doctype` template author. They can also be used by a project's docset owner select and customize the project's templates.

**Version:** 0.1

**Last updated:** February, 2021

## How to use the base-template files 
As a doctype author, you will be responsible for creating three documents:

**xxx-template:**
* Based on the _base-doctype-template_.
* The doctype's headings, standard text, and specific instructions for each section.

**xxx-guide-template:**
* Based on the _base-doctype-guide-template_.
* General guidance and background theory related to the _doctype_.

**xxx-example:**
* Based on the _doctype-example-guide_.
* An example implementation of the doctype, which explains our fake chronologue project.

Guidance for filling out these documents are provided as _template author tips_ within the above documents, as well as in the holistic _main-doctype-author-guide_.
