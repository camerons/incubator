## Introduction

Welcome to our project! This style guide is intended for use by project
contributors, not necessarily end-users. It provides general guidance to anyone
who contributes to the project’s documentation.

## Our preferred style guide

We have adopted the
[your preferred style guide, such as the Google developer's style guide](https://developers.google.com/style)
for {Your Project} documentation. For a quick summary, see the
[Google style guide highlights](https://developers.google.com/style/highlights).
The rest of this document describes our project-specific customizations to
{Google's or your preferred} guide.

Our project uses {your choice: standard American spelling or standard British
spelling, etc.} and our preferred dictionary is the
{[American Heritage Dictionary](https://ahdictionary.com/) or your preferred
dictionary}.

When writing documentation for our project, align with the default guide’s
voice and tone.

## Glossary of preferred terms

<!-- This first paragraph is optional or you could include in the word list. -->

This {Your Project Name} is represented as {example}. It is {always/never}
capitalized.

The table provides guidelines about the terms you should and should not use for
consistency, listed in alphabetical order:

Preferred Term  | Avoid These Terms  |  Explanation
--------------- | -----------------  |  -----------
for example     | e.g.               |  Avoid non-English words
people with disabilities  | <ul><li>the disabled</li><li>disabled people</li><li>people with handicaps</li><li>the handicapped</li></ul>  |  Use inclusive and bias-free language. See [Accessible Writing](#accessible-writing)

- [Write the Docs - Style Guides](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/style-guides/#writing-style)
- [18F Content Guide](https://content-guide.18f.gov/)

## Accessible writing

Documentation should be written in a way that supports people with disabilities
and users with various input methods and devices. Improving accessibility also
helps make documentation clearer and more useful for everyone.

For resources on making your writing more accessible, see:

- [Writing accessible documentation - Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style/accessibility)
- [Accessibility guidelines and requirements - Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/accessibility/accessibility-guidelines-requirements)
- [Writing for Accessibility - Mailchimp Content Style Guide](https://styleguide.mailchimp.com/writing-for-accessibility/)

## Inclusive and bias-free writing

When contributing to this project, you should strive to write documentation with
inclusivity and diversity in mind. Inclusive language recognizes diversity and
strives to communicate respectfully to all people. This kind of language is
sensitive to differences and seeks to promote equal opportunities.

For resources on making your writing more inclusive, see:

- [Inclusive documentation - Google developer’s style guide](https://developers.google.com/style/inclusive-documentation)
- [The Conscious Style Guide - a collection of resources](https://consciousstyleguide.com/)
